# sumo-presentation
The code from my talk on [SUMO](http://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/Simulation_of_Urban_MObility_-_Wiki) given at Rutgers University. The slides for the talk can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/18ynrPb1zMy61C96B8_5Rn1_zaT3Sd9-00MxJ8ngPync/edit?usp=sharing) and the demos are named in order of appearance i.e. folder "one" contains the code for the first demo.

## Running the demos
Enter the directory for any given demo and run the `run.sh` or `run.py` script.

## Thanks
Made with the tutorials found [here](http://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/Tutorials).
